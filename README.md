# cpp-core-programming
A 7-day intensive repository focused on mastering core C++ programming concepts such as functions, pointers, arrays, dynamic memory, and structures—built to establish a strong foundation before OOPS and DSA.


C++ Core Programming (Without OOPS & DSA)

This repository documents my 7-day intensive learning journey focused on building a strong foundation in **core C++ programming**, intentionally excluding Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) at this stage.

The primary goal of this repository is to deeply understand how C++ works at a **fundamental and procedural level**, especially concepts related to memory, program flow, and function execution. Before moving into OOPS, I wanted to ensure clarity in essential building blocks such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and structured programming, which are often the root cause of confusion in advanced C++ concepts.

Throughout this learning period, I focused on writing clean, readable, and logically structured programs rather than memorizing syntax. Each folder in this repository represents a specific day or concept and contains hands-on implementations that demonstrate practical usage of C++ programming constructs.

Topics Covered

- Control statements (if–else, switch, loops)
- Functions, parameter passing, default arguments, and recursion
- One-dimensional arrays and character strings
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`
- Structures and structured data handling
- Menu-driven and logic-based mini projects

Mini Projects

This repository includes small yet meaningful mini projects such as calculators, number utility programs, string analyzers, and a structured record management system. These projects were designed to reinforce conceptual understanding and improve problem-solving skills while working within a procedural programming paradigm.

Learning Outcome

By the end of this 7-day learning phase, I developed confidence in writing C++ programs from scratch, tracing program execution, understanding memory behavior, and debugging common errors. This repository serves as both a **learning log** and a **foundation reference** that I can build upon while transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming and more complex system-level concepts.

This repository reflects my belief that mastering fundamentals is essential before advancing to higher-level abstractions, and it marks the first step in my long-term journey of becoming a proficient software engineer.
